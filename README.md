       This project focused on employing a machine learning-based text mining model to cluster the textual content of Amazon customer review data to identify whether customer will recommend the products to their peers.The dataset is collected from Kaggle with 19,662 observations and 10 variables about the reviews in e-commerce women’s clothing from Amazon platform.

The analysis follows the steps below:
1. Data cleaning&Exploratory analysis
2. Review text data preprocessing 
We have used feature extraction techniques like Bag of Words, TF IDF to preprocessing the text-data for model training
3.Feature extraction
4.Generate Model

 1). Decision tree
 2). Random Forest
 3). K-Means clustering
 4). Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier
 5). topic modeling 
5. Model comparision with selection use Confusion Matrix and ROC curve
